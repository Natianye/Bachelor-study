0,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it directly references the context and asks for a specific piece of information (the decorator to use when overriding methods), which is characteristic of a human seeking clear guidance from documentation. Question B, while plausible, introduces an error scenario (""Mypy does not accept my definition..."") that is not directly described in the context and uses a slightly awkward phrasing with the odd character ""Â "", making it appear more artificial and less focused on the content provided."
1,A,"Question A is more human-like because it asks a broad, open-ended question about whether the user is allowed to contribute changes to the BayBE repository. This kind of general inquiry is typical of a human who is new to an open source project and wants to know if their participation is welcome. In contrast, Question B is narrowly focused and requests specific technical instructions, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated questions tailored to extract a particular detail from the context."
2,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is specific, clearly references the context (""synchronizing a BayBE pull request branch with the latest upstream changes""), and asks for the recommended method, which aligns with how a human familiar with development and the context would phrase a question seeking guidance. Question A is overly broad and generic, lacking context-specific references, making it more likely to be LLM-generated."
3,A,"Question A is more human-like because it directly references the context and asks for a specific piece of information that is clearly answered in the provided documentation. The question is concise and relevant to the details given. Question B, on the other hand, asks about installation procedures, which are not addressed in the context; this suggests it may have been generated without fully considering the content, a trait more typical of LLMs."
4,B,"Question B is more human-like because it asks about the purpose and usage of both the attrs and cattrs libraries, seeking a more explanatory answer that connects their roles. This kind of ""what are X and Y used for?"" question is more typical of a human seeking to understand new terminology or tools in context, as opposed to the more targeted and factual Question A, which simply asks for the name of a library used for a specific purpose."
5,A,"Question A is more human-like because it directly addresses the context (which discusses extending functionality and where to import new public functionality) and asks a specific, relevant question. Question B, on the other hand, asks about supported parameter types, which is not covered in the provided context, making it less relevant and more likely to have been generated by an LLM without close reading."
6,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is specific and asks about a particular detail (the style guide), which is a common human approach when reading documentation. Question A is overly broad and generic (""What is the rule to write docstrings?""), which is more typical of LLM-generated prompts that lack specificity."
7,A,"Attribute docstrings should be placed below the attribute declaration, not in the class docstring, when writing `attrs` classes in BayBE."
8,B,"Question B is more human-like because it uses a conversational tone (""Do I need to..."") and directly mirrors natural language as seen in FAQs. Question A is more formal and uses less common phrasing (""Is it necessary to... in BayBE?""), which is more typical of LLM-generated questions."
9,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it frames the issue in a general, natural way that a typical user might phrase when seeking advice—it's not merely restating the section header but rephrases the central concern in a conversational tone (""Do I have to follow BayBE's recommendations exactly...?""). Question A simply repeats the documentation's section title and doesn't show the usual curiosity or rephrasing that a human would likely use in real inquiry."
10,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is phrased as a conversational, complete question (""How can I install BayBE using pip?""), which is typical of human inquiry. Question B (""How to install BayBE?"") is more terse and lacks a subject, a style more commonly associated with LLM-generated questions or search engine queries."
11,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is phrased as a complete sentence with a personal pronoun (""How can I..."") and specifies ""the latest commit,"" showing an understanding of nuance and intent. Question B is more generic and uses a more terse, LLM-like style (""How to...""), which is less common in conversational human questions."
12,A,"Question A is more human-like because it includes context and motivation (""I want to contribute...""), asks a multi-part, practical question grounded in a real workflow, and requests both a method and a specific command. Question B is short, direct, and more typical of an LLM-generated prompt that only extracts a single fact."
13,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks for a walkthrough of the installation process for BayBE, which is a typical way a human user might seek help when first encountering new software. It is open-ended, conversational, and requests step-by-step guidance. In contrast, Question B is more direct and specific, resembling the precise queries often generated by LLMs or advanced users familiar with technical documentation."
14,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks a direct, simple yes/no question that a typical human might ask when first encountering the topic of telemetry in software. It reflects curiosity about privacy and data collection in plain language. In contrast, Question B is more technical and specific, resembling a query that a developer or someone already familiar with telemetry might ask, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated or documentation-based questions."
15,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks specifically about the optimization methods used by BayBE for handling multiple targets, which demonstrates a nuanced understanding and curiosity about the methodology of the toolbox. Human question-askers often focus on ""how"" something is accomplished, rather than just listing features. In contrast, Question B simply asks about the types of targets supported, which is more straightforward and typical of LLM-generated queries that tend to directly request information from bullet points."
16,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks for a code example and uses a conversational tone (""Give me a code example on how to get started with BayBE""). It seeks practical, actionable information in a way that is common for human users exploring a new library or tool. In contrast, Question B is very direct and specific, which is typical of LLM-generated queries that focus on extracting a single factual detail."
17,A,"Question A is more human-like. It asks a broad, process-oriented question in a conversational tone (""How do I inform BayBE about...""), which is typical of human inquiry when trying to accomplish a task. In contrast, Question B is more specific and technical, focusing narrowly on a particular detail (the encoding method for a specific parameter), which is more characteristic of LLM-generated or documentation-derived questions."
18,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is phrased as a personal, practical inquiry (""Can I combine two recommenders? If yes, how do I do that?""), which is typical of how a human would ask for actionable advice when reading documentation. It also uses first-person (""I""), asks a yes/no question, and follows up for instructions, all of which are common in human questions. In contrast, Question A is more formal and abstract, asking about ""the purpose"" rather than practical use."
19,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific and focused on a concrete action that a user would likely want to perform (""How do you add new experimental measurements to a BayBE campaign?""). It reflects a practical, task-oriented mindset typical of a human reading documentation to solve a real problem. Question B is broader and more general, less likely to be asked by someone with a specific goal in mind."
20,B,"Question B is more human-like because it is more specific and asks about a ""built-in feature"" provided by BayBE for encoding chemical substances in experiments. This phrasing is more typical of a human seeking to understand the available tools or features in detail, whereas Question A is more general and could be interpreted as just asking if such a feature exists."
21,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it expresses a personal experience (""I have issues..."") and asks for a solution in a conversational manner, as a human user would typically do when seeking help. Question B, while clear and precise, is phrased more formally and abstractly, which is characteristic of LLM-generated questions."
22,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is direct, specific, and clearly references the context (""on CPUs without AVX support for BayBE""). It asks exactly what alternative to install, mirroring how a user reading documentation would phrase their query. Question B is vaguer and less specific to the context, as it does not mention the AVX support issue or CPUs, making it feel more generic and likely to be generated by an LLM."
23,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is specific, contextual, and asks for a detailed explanation directly based on the information in the context. It references ""runtime crashes,"" ""torch,"" ""Windows machines,"" and ""BayBE,"" all elements present in the documentation, showing a clear connection to the content. Question A is vague and lacks specificity; it does not mention Windows, torch, or runtime crashes, making it less likely to be written by a human seeking targeted help within this context."
24,A,Python 3.11 introduced ExceptionGroup support used by BayBE's (de-)serialization machinery.
25,A,"Question A is more human-like because it uses casual, appreciative language (""awesome package"") and frames the inquiry in a personal, conversational tone (""Who can I thank""), which is characteristic of how humans often communicate gratitude, rather than the more formal and direct phrasing of Question B."
26,A,"Question A is more human-like because it asks a specific, direct question about a particular contribution (""Bernoulli multi-armed bandit and Thompson sampling""), showing engagement with the context and a desire for a targeted answer. In contrast, Question B is very broad (""Who are the contributors of BayBE?""), which is more typical of an LLM-generated question that simply repeats the section title or asks for an obvious list. Human questions often focus on specific details or show curiosity about particular aspects, as in Question A."
27,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is phrased in a more conversational and personalized way (""What legal rules I must follow when I use or distribute BayBE?""), focusing on the user's obligations and responsibilities. This is typical of how a human might seek practical guidance from documentation, whereas Question A is more factual and terse, resembling the style of many LLM-generated prompts."
28,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it directly references the context and uses a clear, precise formulation that is typical of someone seeking a definition or explanation tied to the provided documentation. It incorporates keywords from the context (""active learning,"" ""experiment selection,"" ""machine learning data acquisition"") and shows an awareness of the specific topic discussed. In contrast, Question B is broader, less specific, and could be asked in many contexts without reference to the particular details from the passage."
29,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is clearly focused, directly references the recommendation aspect (a very human way to seek advice or best practices), and matches the context's explicit guidance. In contrast, Question B is more generic and does not reflect the specific information or recommendations given in the context; it also uses less natural phrasing (""tweak parameters"") without specifying which parameter or the goal of tweaking."
30,B,"Question B is more human-like. It directly and clearly asks what the qNIPV acquisition function integrates in the context of BayBE, focusing on understanding the core concept described in the documentation. In contrast, Question A is less natural: it awkwardly phrases ""a good fraction of random sampling"" and lacks context or specificity—humans are more likely to ask about what the function does or how to use it, rather than requesting a ""good fraction"" without additional context or criteria."
31,B,"Question B is more ""human-like"" because it is phrased from a user's perspective and describes a practical, real-world scenario (""some of my experiments are still running but I need new recommendations""). It uses a conversational tone and directly relates the user's needs to the system's functionality. In contrast, Question A is more technical and abstract, focusing on the definition rather than the user's problem or action."
32,B,"Question B is more human-like because it is specific, clear, and naturally phrased. It uses the context’s terminology directly (""the pending_experiments keyword in BayBE"") and asks about its purpose, which is a typical way a human user would ask when seeking clarification about a particular feature in documentation. Question A, while concise, is vague and less formal; humans, especially in technical contexts, tend to ask for the ""purpose"" or ""function"" of a feature rather than ""what are X good for,"" which is more colloquial and less precise."
33,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is clearly phrased, grammatically correct, and directly asks how to perform a specific action in BayBE, matching the instructional and practical tone of the context. Question B, while relevant, is less clear, uses lower-case 'why', and the phrasing (""add partial result to my experiment model"") is awkward and vague compared to the context, making it sound more like a generated question."
35,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it directly references the method by name and asks specifically what it returns when given a set of candidates, showing an engagement with the API and its outputs. This is typical of a human user wanting to understand the practical result of using a method. Question A is more vague and general, not clearly referencing the context's methods or outputs, and uses the phrase ""my acquisition function,"" which is less precise."
36,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks a direct, practical question in natural language (""How can you save and later restore..."") that aligns closely with how a human user would phrase an information-seeking query after reading about serialization. In contrast, Question B is broader and less specific; it uses more formal, LLM-like language (""best practice,"" ""setting up a long-term experiment"") and is less directly tied to the explicit content of the context, which focuses specifically on serialization and restoring campaign state."
37,B,"Question B is more human-like because it provides a realistic scenario (starting a new optimization project), uses concrete examples (Temperature, Solvent, Yield), and asks how to accomplish a task in the context of the documentation. This shows contextual understanding and a conversational approach typical of human users, whereas Question A is more direct and abstract, focusing only on listing required components."
38,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is phrased in a more specific and goal-oriented way, seeking to understand alternative methods for creating a Campaign, rather than simply confirming a possibility. It uses a more natural and nuanced question structure that suggests curiosity and context-awareness, qualities often found in human-generated questions."
39,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is phrased in a conversational, practical manner, directly addressing a concern a user might have (""Can I just run part of the recommend batch without harming my model?""). It implies a real-world scenario and is less formal. In contrast, Question B is more technical and direct, resembling the style often generated by LLMs when extracting specific information from documentation."
40,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks a direct, clear question about the invalidation of the recommendation cache, which is a natural thing a human user might want to understand when using a system that caches results. The question is straightforward and precise, mirroring the way a real user might seek clarification from documentation. In contrast, Question B is more convoluted and tries to combine multiple aspects (recommending points again and pending experiments) in a way that reads more like an LLM-generated question, focusing on conditional configuration rather than a single, targeted inquiry."
41,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it directly and clearly asks for the method used to add experimental data, demonstrating a straightforward information-seeking approach. Question B, by asking about ""restrictions"" (which are not mentioned in the context), seems to probe for negative information not explicitly covered, a pattern more typical of LLM-generated questions trying to explore edge cases."
42,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is open-ended and practical, focusing on how a user can ensure their experimental constraints are properly implemented, which is a typical concern of someone actually setting up an experiment. It asks for guidance rather than a yes/no answer about a specific technical feature, making it more reflective of natural human inquiry in a documentation context. In contrast, Question A is more narrowly focused and technical, which is common for LLM-generated questions."
43,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it directly asks for an explanation of a specific class (""What does DiscreteSumConstraint do in BayBE?""). This is a clear, focused, and contextually relevant question that a human user who is reading the documentation would likely ask. In contrast, Question A (""How do I implement variable constraints that work for noisy data?"") is more general and introduces the unrelated concept of ""noisy data,"" which is not addressed in the provided context. This makes Question A seem less anchored to the given documentation snippet and more artificially generated."
44,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is phrased in a practical, user-focused way, starting with ""How do I...,"" which is typical of real user queries seeking actionable advice. In contrast, Question A is more formal and abstract, resembling something an LLM might generate when summarizing documentation."
45,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is phrased from a practical perspective (""How do I keep..."") and reflects a real-world user intent or problem. It is direct, conversational, and task-oriented, as a human user would typically ask when seeking to accomplish something in their workflow. Question B, on the other hand, is more generic and fact-seeking, resembling the style of questions often generated by LLMs to extract definitions or explanations."
46,A,"Question A is more human-like. It is phrased as a clear, open-ended inquiry about the consequences of a specific action, which is typical of human curiosity and conversational style. It also avoids the awkward spacing and formatting issues present in Question B. Question B's wording (""Can I create  a `SearchSpace` from multiple`DiscreteDependenciesConstraint`?"") is less natural (extra spaces, missing space after ""multiple"") and more robotic, and is essentially a yes/no question, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated queries attempting to directly map to the documentation."
47,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific, context-aware, and demonstrates an understanding of practical model-building constraints. It references the possibility of already having a DiscreteDependenciesConstraint and asks about using another within the DiscretePermutationInvarianceConstraint. This reflects the kind of nuanced, real-world concern a human practitioner would have, as opposed to the broader, more generic ""what does this do?"" question in B, which is more typical of LLM-generated prompts."
48,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks for an explanation of the purpose or function of the `DiscreteCardinalityConstraint` in a BayBE design, which is a typical way a human would try to understand documentation. Question B is more mechanical and focused on extracting specific code-level details, which is a style more commonly associated with LLM-generated questions."
49,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is direct, specific, and framed in a natural way, asking ""What happens if you try to serialize..."" rather than the more formal or awkward ""Is it possible to use serialization in a use case with custom constraints?"" which sounds less conversational and more like a question an LLM might generate."
50,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is phrased in a natural, conversational manner (""I feel like my constraints have been ignored. Can that happen?""). It also expresses a personal experience and uncertainty, which is typical of how a human might ask for clarification after encountering an unexpected behavior. In contrast, Question B is a direct and precise information request, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated or formal documentation queries."
51,B,"Question B is more human-like because it directly and specifically asks about the function of the ""ContinuousCardinalityConstraint"" in BayBE, demonstrating curiosity about a particular feature mentioned in the context. In contrast, Question A is vague, lacks context, and does not reference the documentation or terminology, making it seem less like a genuine, context-aware human inquiry."
52,B,"Question B is more human-like because it directly asks about the purpose of a specific component (""ThresholdCondition"") in the context of BayBE constraints, which is a typical way a human would seek clarification when reading documentation. Question A, while plausible, is more of a statement of intent and lacks specificity, making it less likely to be a human's documentation query."
53,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks for an explanation of what the DiscreteExcludeConstraint does, reflecting a natural curiosity about the purpose or function of a feature. This is typical of human questioning, which often seeks conceptual understanding. Question B, though valid, is more direct and instructional, which is a style more frequently seen in LLM-generated questions, focusing on the ""how-to"" rather than the ""why"" or ""what."""
54,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific, clear, and asks about a particular use-case (""How can I set an environment variable for BayBE on Windows?""). It references a practical scenario and shows context awareness. Question B is very vague and uses shorthand (""env vars"") that may not be clear to all readers; it also lacks specificity, which is less characteristic of thoughtful human queries."
55,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it directly refers to the context, uses specific terminology from the documentation (""environment variable"", ""disable BayBE telemetry""), and is concise and practical. Question A is unrelated to the provided context and is more abstract, making it less likely to have been written by a human in this scenario."
56,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific, context-aware, and shows an understanding of the documentation provided. It directly references the desire to deactivate Polars ""without changing the Python environment,"" which is exactly addressed in the context. In contrast, Question B is overly broad and lacks the specificity or context sensitivity that a human who had read the provided documentation would likely display."
57,B,"Question B is more human-like. It asks a clear, practical question directly related to the user's ability to control the software's behavior (""How can I disable disk caching in BayBE?""). In contrast, Question A (""WhereÂ is my cache folder?"") contains a typographical error with an extra character (Â), and the wording is less specific, making it feel less natural and more like a machine-generated or copy-pasted query."
58,B,"Question B is more human-like. It is concise, clearly formulated, and directly asks how to enable single precision for both NumPy and PyTorch in BayBE, matching how a human would typically seek instructions or clarification. Question A is more verbose, contains an odd use of question marks before variable names (""?BAYBE_NUMPY_USE_SINGLE_PRECISION""), and is somewhat awkwardly phrased, which is less characteristic of natural human inquiry."
59,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific, clear, and closely tied to the phrasing and structure found in the provided documentation. It uses terms from the context (""stateless,"" ""single batch experiment,"" ""most direct way""), showing careful reading and understanding of the material. In contrast, Question B is too vague and general; it does not reference the key ideas (stateless vs. stateful, batch, etc.) and lacks the specificity and context awareness that a human reader would likely include when seeking actionable guidance from technical documentation."
60,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it reflects a specific, scenario-based inquiry that a user might have when working with BayBE. It uses a natural, conversational tone (""How can I exclude certain parameter configurations..."") and directly references the action the user wants to take. Question B is more generic and less contextualized, using more abstract terminology (""put constraints on the recommendation space""), which is more typical of LLM-generated questions."
61,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is direct, specific, and refers to the context and terminology used in the documentation (""permanently exclude certain parameter configurations from recommendations in BayBE""). It assumes knowledge of BayBE and focuses on the practical ""how,"" which is typical of human users seeking guidance. Question A, while understandable, is more general and less precise, resembling the kind of paraphrased or abstracted queries often generated by LLMs."
62,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is clear, specific, and directly asks about a documented feature (""How can you dynamically exclude specific candidates during a running Campaign in BayBE?""). It shows engagement with the process and uses terminology directly from the documentation. Question B, on the other hand, is vague and lacks detail, making it less typical of a human who has read the documentation chunk provided; it also does not reference the information in the context or provide specifics about the error, which is less characteristic of a well-formed human query."
63,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is specific, directly references the context (parameter importance via SHAP), and asks for concrete information (the class name). In contrast, Question A is vague (""explain the recommendations"") and does not clearly reference the details provided in the context, making it less characteristic of a human who has read and understood the documentation excerpt."
64,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific, directly references the terminology used in the context (""SHAPInsight"" and ""Campaign""), and asks exactly how to perform an action described in the documentation. It shows awareness of both the tool and method, which is characteristic of a human reading documentation to achieve a concrete task.

It shows an understanding of the user's likely goal and refers to a concrete use case, which is characteristic of how humans typically seek help when reading documentation. In contrast, Question B is more general and vague, asking for ""explainability methods"" without anchoring to the specific context or examples provided in the chunk, which is more typical of LLM-generated questions."
66,A,"Question A is more human-like. It is specific, directly references details from the context, and asks about the default explainer class, which aligns with how a human would inquire when seeking a particular technical detail. Question B is more vague and open-ended, lacking a direct reference to the SHAP explainer mechanism discussed in the context."
67,B,"Question B is more human-like because it directly asks for a specific detail (""What flag should be set…"") that a typical user might want to know when using the documentation in practice. It is precise, actionable, and derived from a practical need to use the software. In contrast, Question A is somewhat vague and could be considered less precise, as the answer involves understanding the limitations discussed in the context rather than directly applying the documentation."
69,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific and asks directly about the available scalarization functions within the context of the DesirabilityObjective in BayBE. It references the terminology and concepts presented in the documentation, showing an understanding of the context. Question B is much more open-ended and vague (""How do I combine multiple targets?"") and does not specify the context or refer to technical terms, which is more typical of an LLM-generated or generic question."
70,B,"Question B is more human-like because it asks for a comparative explanation (""What is the difference between...""), which is a common way humans try to deepen their understanding by contrasting concepts. It goes beyond a simple definition or purpose and seeks to clarify nuances, showing curiosity about how two related concepts relate, which is characteristic of human inquiry."
71,A,"Question A is more human-like because it reflects a practical concern a user might have when setting up their experiment, focusing on a real-world scenario (“Can I have two parameters with the same name in one campaign?”). It is conversational and considers potential mistakes or misunderstandings a user could make. Question B is more direct and factual, resembling the style of questions generated by LLMs to extract a specific piece of information from documentation."
72,B,"Question B is more human-like. It is clear, specific, and directly references the example values from the context, which is typical of a human seeking clarification with concrete examples. In contrast, Question A uses slightly awkward phrasing (""if I allow my variables to have discrete and numerical values?"") and includes a strange character (Â), both of which are more indicative of text generated or altered by an LLM. Additionally, humans tend to ask with direct reference to their use case or examples, as in Question B."
73,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is specific, focused, and directly related to the context, asking about the types of encoding supported for CategoricalParameter in BayBE. This is the kind of clear, concrete question a human user interested in the documentation would ask to understand the options available. Question A is vague and incomplete, lacking a clear question or connection to the context, which is less characteristic of a typical human-written query."
74,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is short, uses a natural, instructional tone (""How do I create...""), and focuses on a practical task that a user would want to accomplish. It asks broadly for the process, which is typical of human users seeking help with software.

84,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it directly and specifically asks what must be explicitly provided when using `SearchSpace.from_dataframe`, focusing on the requirement mentioned in the context. The question is concise, clear, and targets a specific detail, which is characteristic of human inquiry when seeking to clarify a process or requirement. In contrast, Question B is more general and does not engage as deeply with the nuance described in the context; it could be written by either a human or an LLM, but A shows more specific engagement with the documentation."
85,A,"Question A is more human-like. It is open-ended and uses natural language (""How can you restrict search spaces in BayBE?""), inviting a detailed explanation. In contrast, Question B is shorter and uses a more technical, direct phrasing (""Can I define constraints for my parameters?""), which is more typical of LLM-generated queries."
86,B,"Question B is more human-like because it asks a clear, practical ""how-to"" question specific to the context and the tool (BayBE). It references ""all possible combinations of given parameter values"" and directly asks about construction, which aligns closely with human users looking to accomplish a concrete task. In contrast, Question A is more abstract and less anchored in the specifics of the context, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated or overly general questions."
87,B,"Question B is more human-like because it is conversational and task-oriented (""How do I...""), which is typical of human queries. It asks for practical guidance using common language. In contrast, Question A is more formal and explicitly references implementation details, which is characteristic of LLM-generated questions."
88,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is specific and directly references the concept and terminology (""simplex constraint"") introduced in the documentation. It asks precisely how to achieve a certain functionality described in the context, showing awareness of the technical detail. In contrast, Question B is more vague and generic, lacking the detail and specificity that a human reader, after seeing the documentation, would likely include."
89,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is specific and directly references details from the context (""two internal dataframes"" and asking for their names). Human-written questions often focus on concrete details and request specific information, whereas Question B is broader and more vague (""how is the data... represented and handled""), which is characteristic of some LLM-generated queries that seek general overviews rather than targeted facts."
90,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it uses more specific and contextual language (""continuous subspace with explicit bounds in BayBE""), demonstrating an understanding of the terminology and naming conventions within the framework. The phrasing is also more natural for someone familiar with the software, whereas Question A is more generic and less tailored to the documented context."
91,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is specific and refers directly to the implementation detail (""shape of continuous subspace"") that a human reading technical documentation would likely be curious about, especially after seeing the code and explanation. Question B is broader and more generic, more characteristic of an LLM trying to generalize rather than asking about the specific behavior described."
92,A,"Question A is more human-like because it directly refers to the context and asks a clear, relevant question about how to use alternative constructors during deserialization in BayBE, which is the main topic of the provided documentation. Question B, on the other hand, is vague, unrelated to the context, and does not refer to any information in the chunk, making it less human-like and less likely to have been written by someone familiar with the specific documentation."
93,B,"Question B is more human-like because it is phrased from a personal perspective (""My DataFrame... I don't understand. How can I read it and edit it?""), demonstrates a direct user problem, and expresses confusion and a desire for a practical solution. In contrast, Question A is phrased in a more formal, technical, and detached manner, typical of LLM-generated or documentation-style queries."
94,B,"Question B is more human-like because it asks specifically about the process (""How can BayBE objects be serialized and deserialized to and from JSON?"") rather than just confirming the existence of a feature. Human users often seek actionable information or guidance on usage, rather than simply asking if a capability exists. Additionally, the phrasing of B is more open-ended and invites a detailed explanation, which is typical of human inquiries."
95,A,"Question A is more human-like. It presents a practical, real-world scenario (""I want to use a parameter for an API call later"") and asks if a certain action is possible (""Is it possible to create a JSON string directly?""). This contextualizes the question and gives a reason for asking, which is typical of human queries. In contrast, Question B is more generic and formal, asking in a textbook style without personal context or motivation."
96,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it specifically refers to the process of deserialization in the context of BayBE and asks how default values are handled, which aligns with how a human might seek to understand the mechanics described in the documentation. It also uses more precise terminology (""default values,"" ""deserializing,"" ""CategoricalParameter,"" ""configuration string,"" ""BayBE""), showing awareness of and engagement with the context. Question A is more general and less specific to the documentation and its examples."
98,B,"Question B is more human-like because it is more specific and situational, referencing the practical challenge of nested objects and the need to ensure correct subclass deserialization. Human users are more likely to phrase questions in terms of real-world use cases or problems they're facing (""How do you make sure...?"") rather than asking for a general definition (""What is the purpose...?""), which is more typical of LLMs or documentation-style queries."
99,A,"Question A is more human-like. It is clearly phrased, uses natural language, and refers specifically to the context (""classes with an abbreviation class variable"" and ""be deserialized in BayBE""). Question B is less clear (""abbreviated class variables"" could be misinterpreted as variables that have short names, rather than classes with an abbreviation variable). The grammar and specificity of Question A are more characteristic of a human-written query."
100,B,"Question B is more human-like. It uses a conversational tone (""How do I...""), asks multiple related sub-questions, provides context about the user's specific situation (""I have multiple targets""), and clearly connects the questions to practical use. In contrast, Question A is vague and less natural in wording (""how do I format my input objective?""), lacking detail and context that a human user would likely provide when seeking help."
101,A,"Question A is more human-like. It is explicit, concise, and directly asks for the two main interpretations of ""simulation"" as described in the context. It mirrors the way a human would ask for clarification based on a clearly labeled list in documentation. Question B is vaguer and less directly tied to the structure of the context; it asks about ""a difference"" in handling, which is less precise and somewhat open-ended, a style more commonly seen in LLM-generated questions."
102,B,"Question B is more human-like because it is specific and directly references a tool or feature (""What decorator can be used in BayBE...""), showing familiarity with typical developer workflows and naming conventions. Question A is more generic and open-ended, which is characteristic of LLM-generated questions that often lack specificity or context-awareness. Humans familiar with documentation tend to ask about specific tools or solutions provided, as in B."
105,B,"Question B (""What does the simulate_experiment function in BayBE return?"") is more 'human-like' because it is specific, asks about the output of the function, and refers directly to the function within its software context. Human users often want to know what they will get back from a function, especially in documentation. In contrast, Question A (""How to simulate a single experiment?"") is more generic and less targeted, which is often characteristic of LLM-generated queries trying to broadly cover a topic."
106,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is conversational, uses a personal pronoun (""I'm interested""), and asks for practical guidance (""can you show me how to do that?""). This reflects a natural human approach to asking for help or instructions, often seen in forums or to colleagues. In contrast, Question B is more technical, direct, and formal, resembling the style of an LLM-generated question aimed at extracting specific information."
107,A,"Question A (""Can I use the `simulate_transfer_learning` function for continuous search spaces?"") is more human-like. It is phrased as a practical, personal inquiry (""Can I use...""), which is typical of human users seeking direct application advice. In contrast, Question B is more formal and descriptive, resembling the style of LLM-generated questions that often ask for a summary or restatement of documentation."
108,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks directly and straightforwardly about the available surrogate models in BayBE, reflecting a practical and typical human information-seeking style. It is concise, clear, and directly references a list present in the context. Question B, while relevant, is more generic and less specific to the detailed context provided."
109,A,"Question A is more human-like because it directly seeks clarification about a process described in the documentation (""How does BayBE handle...""), using natural phrasing and showing engagement with the content. Question B, while plausible, seems less likely to be written by a human in this context because it presumes the existence of an override mechanism (""overwrite the auto-replication method"") that is not discussed in the provided documentation, and its phrasing is more technical and less conversational."
111,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is phrased in a practical, conversational way, reflecting a user's real-world intent (""Can I reference the current surrogate model to use it outside of the standard optimization loop?"") rather than focusing narrowly on recalling a method name. It demonstrates curiosity about usage and implications, which is typical of human inquiry. In contrast, Question B is more direct and technical, resembling the style of a prompt generated to extract a specific fact, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated questions."
112,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it combines two related queries in a conversational tone, using phrases like ""Could you tell me about..."" which are more characteristic of human communication. In contrast, Question A is direct and specific, which is common in LLM-generated queries."
113,A,"Question A is more 'human-like'. It is clear, directly references the documentation, and asks about a specific attribute (""mode"") in a way that a user seeking to understand functionality would do. Question B, while plausible, is less precise, contains a typographical error (""Âinf""), and is more speculative. Question A better demonstrates the focused and purposeful inquiry typical of human users seeking information from documentation."
114,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it directly references the context (NumericalTarget and its use for categorical targets), and is clear, specific, and relevant to the provided documentation. Question B is unrelated to the context, which is about targets, not parameters like temperature. Human-written questions are more likely to focus on and engage directly with the presented information."
115,A,"Question A is more human-like because it asks a contextual, interpretive question (""what determines the optimal target value?"") that is directly related to understanding the functionality described in the documentation. It shows curiosity about the underlying logic of the MATCH mode. Question B, while valid, is more formulaic and focused on terminology or syntax, which is more characteristic of LLM-generated questions that often focus on specific keywords or code."
116,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is concise, focused, and asks for clarification on how a specific term is defined within the context of BayBE. Human users often seek to understand the meaning or application of a concept in a particular context, rather than asking a list of yes/no questions as in Question A, which is more typical of LLM-generated prompts."
117,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is phrased in the first person (""Can I use... in my campaign""), directly addresses a practical concern, and uses a conversational tone. This style is typical of human users seeking guidance for their specific use case, while Question A is more formal and abstract, resembling the kind of query an LLM might generate when summarizing documentation."
118,A,"Question A is more human-like. It is specific, directly references the context provided (BayBE experiment recommendations and TaskParameter values), and asks a practical ""how-to"" question relevant to the documentation. Question B, while plausible, is overly broad and does not engage directly with the details in the context, making it feel more like an LLM-generated question."
119,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it is direct, specific, and seeks an explicit utility name as an answer, which mirrors how a human typically asks for help with documentation. Question B, while plausible, is phrased more generally and refers to ""after applying my constraints,"" which the context specifically warns is not possible with the provided utility. The specificity and context alignment in Question A make it more natural and human-like."
120,A,"Question A is more 'human-like' because it asks a nuanced, context-aware question about how the temporary seed interacts with other tools like numpy—a detail-oriented, clarifying question that a human user might ask when concerned about the implications of setting seeds, especially if they have prior experience with reproducibility issues in Python. Question B is more direct and closely mirrors the documentation, less likely to reflect a human's broader concerns or prior knowledge."
121,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it is framed from a developer's perspective, expressing a practical concern during development (""How can I efficiently test my code...""). It asks a broader question that implies a need for a solution, which is typical of human queries seeking practical advice. In contrast, Question A is more direct and specific, resembling the precise style often used by LLMs to extract information."
122,A,"Question A (""How can I disable all telemetry in BayBE?"") is more human-like. This question is phrased as a direct, practical inquiry that a user concerned with privacy or configuration would naturally ask when using software. It focuses on actionable steps, aligns with common user concerns, and uses a conversational tone (""How can I...""). In contrast, Question B is more formal and detached, resembling the style often generated by LLMs when summarizing documentation."
123,B,"Question B is more human-like. It uses a specific product name (""BayBE""), asks directly about disabling telemetry (matching the documentation terminology), and is phrased as a clear, practical ""how can I"" question, which is typical of real users seeking actionable steps. Question A is vaguer and uses less precise language (""collection of usage statistics""), which is more generic and less likely to be how a real user familiar with the tool would ask."
124,B,"Question B is more 'human-like' because it uses natural, conversational language (""How do you add new experimental measurements to a BayBE campaign?"") rather than the more formal and slightly awkward phrasing of Question A. Additionally, Question B refers directly to ""a BayBE campaign,"" which aligns with how a human would frame the question given the context, while Question A uses ""the campaignÂs database,"" which is less natural and contains an encoding artifact (""Â"")."
125,A,"Question A is more human-like because it is specific and directly related to the context, asking exactly how BayBE objects can be serialized and deserialized to and from JSON. It references the terminology and methods explicitly mentioned in the documentation (i.e., serialization, deserialization, JSON), and is clear about the process it wants explained. Question B is more vague (""transform into a different format""), which could apply to many things, and does not reference JSON or the specific serialization features discussed in the context. This specificity and contextual awareness make A more human-like."
