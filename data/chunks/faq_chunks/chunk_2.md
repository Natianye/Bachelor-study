# FAQ
### Do I need to create a campaign to get recommendations?

No, creating a campaign is not mandatory.
BayBE offers two entry points for generating recommendations:

* a stateful [`Campaign.recommend`]() method and
* a stateless [`RecommenderProtocol.recommend`]() method.

For more details on when to choose one method over the other,
see [here](userguide/getting_recommendations.md).
