# Constraints
## Conditions

Conditions are elements used within discrete constraints.
While discrete constraints can operate on one or multiple parameters, a condition
always describes the relation of a single parameter to its possible values.
It is through chaining several conditions in constraints that we can build complex
logical expressions for them.
