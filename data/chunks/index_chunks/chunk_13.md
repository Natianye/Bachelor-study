# BayBE â€” A Bayesian Back End for Design of Experiments
## ðŸ’» Installation
### Optional Dependencies

There are several dependency groups that can be selected during pip installation, like

```bash
pip install 'baybe[test,lint]' # will install baybe with additional dependency groups `test` and `lint`
```

To get the most out of `baybe`, we recommend to install at least

```bash
pip install 'baybe[chem,simulation]'
```
