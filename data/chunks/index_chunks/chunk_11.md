# BayBE â€” A Bayesian Back End for Design of Experiments
## ðŸ’» Installation
### From GitHub

If you need finer control and would like to install a specific commit that has not been
released under a certain version tag, you can do so by installing BayBE directly from
GitHub via git and specifying the corresponding
[git ref](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/#git).

For instance, to install the latest commit of the main branch, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/emdgroup/baybe.git@main
```
