Your factoid question should be answerable with a specific, concise piece of factual information from the context.
Your factoid question should be formulated in the same style as questions BayBE users could ask in a search engine.
Your factoid question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans.
This means that your factoid question MUST NOT mention something like "according to the passage" or "context".
